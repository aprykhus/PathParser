# Description
The PATH command in Windows just outputs the PATH variable as one long semicolon delimeted string. Not so easy to read. The Environment Variables GUI can be cumbersome if you have many entries. This batch file parses the PATH variable and prints each entry on its own line and sorts by SYSTEM and USER variables.
# Installation
